Two of the new features regarding SSL that we have been working on include adding support for configuring multiple
certificate revocation lists and ``SSLv2Hello`` support. These features did not make it into WildFly 23
but we have plans for them to be included in WildFly 24.

== An Overview of Certificate Revocation Lists

Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) contain a list of certificates that have been revoked
by the issuing Certificate Authority before their expected expiration date, and therefore should no longer
be trusted. Elytron currently supports configuring only one Certificate Revocation List.

From WildFly 24, it will be possible to configure multiple CRL files, which is useful when several certificate
authorities are used.


=== Certificate Revocation List Configuration

Support for multiple CRLs will be available for both the server and client. Currently, in the Elytron Subsystem, we can
configure a single CRL in the ``trust-manager`` element using the ``certificate-revocation-list`` attribute.
From WildFly 24, we will be able to configure a list of certificate revocation lists using the new ``certificate-revocation-lists`` attribute.


== An Overview of the SSLv2Hello Protocol

Older JDK versions use ``SSLv2Hello`` during the initial handshake message
where the ``SSL`` version that will be used for the rest of the handshake is negotiated.

The use of this protocol is discouraged. As a result, newer JDK versions disable this
protocol by default for clients, but do provide the ability to re-enable it if needed.

By adding ``SSLv2Hello`` as a supported protocol in WildFly, we are ensuring older
clients are still able to communicate to servers guaranteeing parity with legacy security.

=== SSLv2Hello Configuration

``SSLv2Hello`` will be enabled by configuring it in the ``protocols`` attribute in the
SSL context definition in the Elytron subsystem: the ``server-ssl-context`` and ``client-ssl-context`` for the
server and client respectively. The attribute ``protocols`` contains the list of protocols supported by WildFly.
From WildFly 24, this attribute will also allow ``SSLv2Hello`` to be specified.



== Summary

This blog post has given an overview of the upcoming support for multiple certificate revocation lists and
``SSLv2Hello``.

For more details on these features, keep an eye on https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WFCORE-5170[WFCORE-5170]
and https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WFCORE-5145[WFCORE-5145] respectively.
